# Logistic-Regression

1. Implement logistic regression to classify the images provided in the dataset.
2. You are not allowed to use scikit-learn or any other machine learning library/framework
for this purpose. You may use numpy(for Eigendecomposition and other linear algebra functionality) and OpenCV for Image I/O.
3. For this process, you will first perform PCA on the training set and use the feature
vectors obtained after dimensionality reduction to perform logistic regression.
4. Report accuracy score, Confusion matrix and any other metrics you feel useful.
